MobArenaInfo
============
A simple plugin for Minecraft Bukkit servers.
It requires the server to have MobArena and Spout installed, and the player to have the Spoutcraft client-side mod.
The plugin will display text on the player's screen informing them when the next wave is reached.

PLEASE NOTE: This plugin is obsolete, as MobArena now does this by default.
